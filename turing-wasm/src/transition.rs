/*
    Transition is a struct that represents a transition in a Turing Machine. 

    Attributes:
    current_state : the state that the machine must be in order to execute this transition
    current_symbol : the symbol that the machine must read in order to execute this transition
    new_state : the state that the machine will be after executing this transition
    new_symbol : the symbol that the machine will write after executing this transition
    direction : the direction that the machine will move after executing this transition

    Methods:
    new : acts as a constructor for Transition, it receives the current state, current symbol, new state, new symbol and direction

    Example of declaring a transition:
    transition: transition::Transition::new('0', 'a', '1', 'A', direction::Direction::Right)
    */

use direction;
